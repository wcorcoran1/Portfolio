        <p>
         I am a software engineer and 
         I am a Fullstack Academy graduate. I learned a lot in the three months of the full time class. 
         Fullstack helped sparked my passion for creating things through software development. 
         I am looking for the opportunity to continue to grow as a developer and as professional.
